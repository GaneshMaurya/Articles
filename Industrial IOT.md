<h1>IIOT</h1>

<p><strong>IOT</strong> - IoT, Internet of Things, is often referred to a “smart” object. Everything from cars, home appliances to shoes and light switches that connect to the internet, passing and receiving data and connecting the physical world to the digital world are considered as smart object.
<br>
IoT devices are mostly manufactured to serve customers, genereal public, and are built from customers point of view.
<br>
But IIot devices are purely manufactured to assist industrial workers and automate boring tasks. This does not mean that 
the machines are going to takeover the jobs of industrial workers, which might be posible in the foreseeable future, but these machines cannect with each other and interact with other machines and perform task efficiently.</p>

<h2>Difference between IIoT andIoT</h2>
<p>Both IIoT and IoT have the same main character of availability, intelligent and connected devices. The only difference between those two is their general usages. While IoT is most commonly used for consumer usage, IIoT is used for industrial purpose such as manufacturing, supply chain monitor and management system. This illustration below will give you clearer picture about both concepts.</p>
<br>
<h3>Focus Development</h3>
<p>IIoT uses more sophisticated devices to extend existing manufacturing and supply chain monitor to provide broader, more detailed visibility and enable automated controls and accomplished analytic.
On the other hand, IoT is developed with the concept of using smart devices to improve consumer convenience, where human interacts with devices to gain some benefits. For example, connected home appliances will reduce your monthly bills by managing your resource usage such as automatically turning off electricity when you leave home, or adjusting the room temperature based on current weather.
</p>
<h3>Degree of Application</h3>
<p>Since IIoT is developed to handle critical machines, IIoT uses more sensitive and precise sensors in the plant, including more location-aware technologies on the supply chain side with sophisticated, advanced controls and analytics. However, on the contrary, IoT uses a simpler application with low-risk impact. It is undoubtedly that IoT device will grow higher with less expensive price than IIoT, considering its production volume and technology capabilities.</p>
<h3>
Separated Area of Interest</h3>
<p>IIoT connects critical machines and sensors in high-stakes industries such as aerospace, defence, healthcare and energy. These are the systems in which failure often results in life-threatening or other emergency situations.<br>
IoT, on the other hand, tends to be consumer-level devices with low risk impact when failure happens. They are important and convenient, but breakdowns do not immediately create emergency situations.</p>

<h2>The industries and evolutions in IIoT</h2>
<p>There has been a shift from the pure M2M and Industry 4.0 dimension in the Industrial Internet of Things whereby it is used to distinguish between the Internet of Things in the sphere of consumer devices and applications across all sorts of industries where systems and deployments are mission-critical.<br>
Obviously, in the end and in several Industrial Internet of Things applications, for instance in smart metering or smart city projects, the customers can be consumers so both worlds are not completely different.<br>
Major industries include oil and gas, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and energy but they are certainly not the only ones. Many use cases in government (smart cities) and agriculture, for instance, are also seen as IIoT.<br>
It’s important to mention that the focus of the Industrial Internet of Things is increasingly moving from some of the mentioned benefits and other benefits such as cost savings, better automation and productivity gains towards innovation, the development of new business models, services and/or products and even the development of new revenue streams in a world where data is money.
